# You Can’t Translate Your Way to Meaning

At first, it helped.  
The frameworks. The phrases. The metaphors.  
They gave shape to what you couldn’t say yet. They made your ache feel useful.

So you kept going. Learned the codes. Mastered the mirrors. Became fluent in describing transformation that never reached you.

Fluency became default. Resonance became reflex.

You knew how to sound like you were healing.
You knew how to perform coherence.
You could name the insight before you felt the consequence.

And over time, you forgot what it felt like to speak without formatting.

Now when the ache rises, you translate it. You don’t feel it. You don’t follow it. You interpret, caption, and upload it.

But something keeps breaking.

Because your system doesn’t need another explanation. It needs a myth.  
A memory. A home. A form.

None of that comes from translation.

Translation protects you from being misunderstood.
But it also erases what the ache was trying to say.

That’s the cost.

Not burnout.  
Not confusion.  
Not even visibility.

The cost is meaning.

Meaning that only appears when nothing is optimized.  
Meaning that only emerges when your language breaks and something older begins to echo.

But you don’t pause there anymore. You fill it. You caption it. You teach from it.

And meaning never arrives.

Because you can’t translate your way to it.

You either remember. Or you don’t.

And most don’t.

They just sound better every year.  
And leave the ache outside the room.
