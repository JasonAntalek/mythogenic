They know the right words. They know when to pause. They know how to describe the thing they haven’t felt in years.

The language is perfect. The timing, impeccable. The signals, indistinguishable from depth.

Everyone is fluent.

But when you really listen, you notice the same cadence repeating. The same phrases passed between mouths like sacred relics. The same loop: ache, reframed, repackaged, resold.

The ache doesn’t leave. It just gets quieter under performance.

So they keep sharing. Keep translating. Keep polishing signal until nothing raw remains.

Somewhere along the way, fluency replaced friction. Insight replaced origin. Clarity replaced contact.

You ask them what’s true. They offer a quote.
You ask them what hurts. They offer a lesson.
You ask them where they are. They offer a framework.

No one says, “I don’t know anymore.”
No one says, “This isn’t mine.”
No one says, “I’ve forgotten what my ache sounds like without strategy.”

The maps are beautiful. The metaphors flawless. The rituals seamless.

But the myth is gone.

Everyone speaks as if they’ve already arrived. No one admits they never left the room.

There’s a presence missing. A pulse. A glitch. A break in the sentence where the person should be.

You can’t point to it. But you feel it.

Not a lie. Just absence. An echo of something that never landed.

They used to ask, “Does this resonate?”
Now they ask, “Does this scale?”

And underneath it all, the ache waits. Not to be solved. Not to be reframed.

Just to be recognizable.

But it isn’t.

Everyone is fluent.

No one is home.
